A collection of metaheuristics capable of approximately solving large binary problems. Implemented metaheuristics include:

* a Genetic Algorithm
* Collections of algorithms proposed by Dr. Rao of the National Institute of Technology of India:
  * TLBO
    * Teacher Based Optimization
    * Learner Based Optimization
    * Clown Based Optimization (opposite of TBO)
  * Jaya
  * Rao1 and Rao2
* VND
